<h1> Top 3 Ranked Movies of 2024 </h1>
<h2> A Short Critique by Judith.</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    2024 seems to be a good year for movies. Although, I have not watched a lot of movies this year, but all of them seemed good to watch, and I would likely recommend you to watch as well. I will rank from top 3 down to my top 1 movie choice.

<h3>3. Carry On</h3>

<p> 
    Earning the 3rd spot this year. I liked how this thriller/mystery movie made me think how the lead male would be able to save his girlfried while saving the people from the airport as well. 
</p>

<h3>2. It Ends With Us</h3>

<p> 
    Here is my number two choice. This follows the story of a woman who grew up with an abusive father and tries to find love, only to find out that her lover is also an abusive man. Great story.

<h3>1. 911</h3>

<p> 
    Not a movie, but as I have said earlier, I have not watched a lot of movies this year or mmaybe I just couldn't remember what I did watch. I would highly recommend this series to burn time.
